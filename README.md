# The Neglected 95% Dashboard

Welcome to the Neglected 95% Dashboard!

A large proportion of first authors in psychology and behavioural science are located in North America or Europe, mostly in the US (Thalmayer et al., 2021, Arnett, 2008). Thus, most of the world, and especially Africa and Latin America, are underrepresented, which could affect the validity and generalizability of psychological research. This dashboard presents some aggregated data by continent, country, year, and journal (for first authors only), to better document this trend over time and, possibly, inform future public policy on the matter.
